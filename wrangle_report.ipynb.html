This report gives a step by step explanation of process carried out while cleaning the data given to us. The dataset provided by Udacity was used while working on this project. I imported the dataset using the pandas read_csv and read_json function. I also accessed the data virtually by scrolling through the data provided. 
Afterwards, I moved on to access the data programmatically by using the pandas head, info, describe and duplicated function. I also made sure to check for missing values using the pandas isnull and sum function. 
After access the function, I came up with the following quality and tidiness issues: 
 
### Quality issues 
 
#### Archived Tweets 
##### 1. Missing Values 
 
Missing values are present in the following columns: 
 
* in_reply_to_status_id 
 
* in_reply_to_user_id 
 
* retweeted_status_id 
 
* retweeted_status_user_id 
 
* retweeted_status_timestamp 
 
##### 2. Validity Error. 
* The rating_numerator are sometimes above the rating_denominator column. 
 
* Some dogs where without name 
 
#### Predicted Images with Neural Network. 
 
* Some Images were not Dogs. 
 
#### Twitter API json file. 
##### 3. Missing Values 
Missing values present in the following columns: 
 
* in_reply_to_status_id 
 
* in_reply_to_status_id_str 
 
* in_reply_to_user_id 
 
* in_reply_to_user_id_str 
 
* in_reply_to_screen_time 
 
* geo 
 
* coordinates 
 
 
### Tidiness issues 
* The columns converted to strings still has an integer datatype. 
* The data included tweets that were retweeted, and not originally owned by the page.

</span><span class="s1">In solving the listed issues, I started with dropping the columns with a large number of missing values from the twitter_archived data and tweet_json dataset. Columns like the in_reply_to_status_id, in_reply_to_user_id, retweeted_status_id, retweeted_status_user_id, retweeted_status_timestamp and expanded_urls. I dropped off these columns since filling up this would only lead to inaccurate and inappropriate data being added to the data. 
</span><span class="s0">#%% md 
</span><span class="s1">Also for some columns present have a wrong datatype. I changed the datatype of this column to the right datatype. 
I then merged the dataset together using the pandas merge function. Then, I saved the final output of the dataset to twitter_archive_master.csv file which can be seen in the under the Github repository.</span></pre>
